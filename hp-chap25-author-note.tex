Author's Note
\end{center}

Since the science in this story is usually all correct, I include a warning
that in Ch.~22--25 Harry overlooks many possibilities, the most important of
which is that there are lots of magical genes but they're all on one chromosome
(which wouldn't happen naturally, but the chromosome might have been
engineered). In this case, the inheritance pattern would be Mendelian, but the
magical chromosome could still be degraded by chromosomal crossover with its
nonmagical homologue. (Harry has read about Mendel and chromosomes in science
history books, but he hasn't studied enough actual genetics to know about
chromosomal crossover. Hey, he's only eleven.) However, although a modern
science journal would find a \emph{lot} more nits to pick, everything Harry
presents as strong evidence is in fact strong evidence --- the other
possibilities are \emph{improbable}.
