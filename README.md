This is an edition of Eliezer Yudkowsky's fanfiction [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/),
building on top of the amazing work done in https://github.com/knuesel/hpmor/.

# List of changes
- Change some fonts
- Change page organization
- 6 -> 3 books
- Use pgfornament to draw chapter outlines and separators
- Covers for printing with lulu.com
- Clean up the titles of the omake files (removing artefacts and the like)
- Change the style for parseltongue from a different font to "snake-quotes"

The covers are generated by the `cover-[123].tex` files, with images generated
using the `flame` program in `fractal-generator` (with `flame_in[123].txt` as
inputs). Image generation takes a while and requires ~128GB of RAM with the
current settings. Change the `16 4096 8192` values on the last line of
`flame_in[123].txt` to reduce resource usage at the cost of (some) quality.
