% We want the total number of real pages (sheets) to be a multiple of 2, and we
% want the colophon to land on the last page (which will necessarily be an even
% page). So we might need to insert up to 1 blank page before the colophon.
%
% Note that the \include command used to include this file makes a new page, so
% if the current page here is a multiple of 4, we don't need to insert any blank
% page.
%
% First we calculate the current page number modulo 2:
\makeatletter
\@tempcnta=\c@sheetsequence% The sheetsequence counter defined by the memoir class
\newcount\blobb
\blobb=\c@sheetsequence
\divide\@tempcnta by 2
\multiply\@tempcnta by 2
\multiply\@tempcnta by -1
\advance\@tempcnta by \c@sheetsequence
%
% Now @tempcnta holds @sheetsequence % 4. We will add pages and increment @tempcnta
% until it reaches 4 (unless it is 0, in which case there is no page to add).
\ifnum\@tempcnta>0
\loop
\thispagestyle{empty}% Disable headers/footers
\null% There must be "something" on the current page for \newpage to have an effect
\newpage% Make new page
\advance\@tempcnta by 1
\ifnum\@tempcnta<2
\repeat
\fi
\makeatother
%
% Now the current page is a muliple of 2. We put the colophon here.
